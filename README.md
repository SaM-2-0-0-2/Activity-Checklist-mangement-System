The Checklist Management System, implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming principles, offers a robust solution for organizing and monitoring tasks. 
The system employs a Task class to encapsulate task details, promoting modularity and code organization. Users interact with the system through a menu-driven console interface, allowing them to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display the current checklist. 
This design enhances user experience and showcases foundational OOP concepts such as encapsulation and inheritance.

The modular structure and intuitive functionality of the Checklist Management System lay a solid foundation for further development and integration. 
The program's error-handling mechanisms ensure a smooth user experience by addressing invalid inputs. 
The system serves as a practical template for building more sophisticated task management applications, illustrating the practical application of OOP principles in creating scalable and maintainable software solutions.
